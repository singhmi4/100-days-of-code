# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CommandLine section in Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy.
Installed CodeAnywhere, installed the node.js and mongoDB files, learned basic command line actions

**Thoughts:** I did not know too much about back-end developing before installing CodeAnywhere application. However, I feel a lot better after installing the application, learning the basic command line actions, and getting a better understanding about what Node.JS is and why it is used

### Day 2: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Defined 3D Character movement and camera rotation in Unity

**Thoughts:** 

*Unity Game Development:*
Creating character movement in Unity was a lot simpler than expected. However, character camera rotation was slightly more challenging. Adding the Y rotation camera movement to the Player GameObject directly caused the Player to move forward/backward. The script caused the player to rotate in the Y direction thus affecting the velocity in the Y direction. The solution to this, pointed out by the Unity instructor, was to create a GameObject specifically for pivoting along the x-axis and nest it within the Player object and nest the Main Camera in the new GameObject. This didn't cause the Player itself to rotate when the camera was rotated about the x-axis.

*Web Development:*
Update later to come!

##### **Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday
**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
